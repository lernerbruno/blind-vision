# blind-vision

Project developed in 2 days for ITC Hackaton 2019, where the theme was Mobility.

It consists of a program written in `Processing`, that runs with a `Kinect`. It detects persons, obstacles and final destination and creates audio messages to alert the user (in case of a visually impaired person). It also sends the data to a highly contrast web interface that provides the information in a much more clear way, like a radar.

It won the `first place`, by popular vote.
